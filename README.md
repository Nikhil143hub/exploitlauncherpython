## Introduction

The exploit launcher tool is designed to demonstrate basic functionalities of scanning for vulnerabilities, generating Metasploit payloads, and launching exploits. It includes a simplified exploit database, a scanner function, a payload generator, and an exploit launcher function.

## Usage

To use the exploit launcher tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/exploit-launcher-tool.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd exploit-launcher-tool
   ```

3. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python exploitlauncherpython.py
   ```

## Exploit Database

The exploit database (`exploits` dictionary) contains information about known exploits, including the vulnerability name, target OS, architecture, and payload.

## Scanner

The scanner function (`scan_target`) attempts to connect to a target IP and port to check if it's reachable. This is a basic check and doesn't confirm vulnerabilities.

## Payload Generator

The payload generator function (`generate_payload`) generates a Metasploit payload command based on the selected exploit name. It uses hard-coded values for the listener host (`LHOST`) and port (`LPORT`).

## Exploit Launcher

The exploit launcher function (`launch_exploit`) takes a target IP and an exploit name, generates the payload command, and launches the exploit using `subprocess.call`.

## Example Usage

```python
target_ip = "192.168.0.1"
target_port = 445

if scan_target(target_ip, target_port):
    print(f"Target {target_ip} is vulnerable to MS17-010")
    launch_exploit(target_ip, "MS17-010")
else:
    print(f"Target {target_ip} is not vulnerable to MS17-010")
```
